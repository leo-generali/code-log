# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, July 14, 2017

I'm going to try and take this coding log thing seriously. I've tried to do it twice now, but everytime I completely forget to update it. That's dumb. It's not like I'm not coding too, so my excuse is one of pure laziness. 

I've streamlined the process for myself a little bit, which I'm hoping will make things easier for me. Installed [Typora](https://typora.io/) on my computer and [Byword](https://bywordapp.com/) on my phone. Both of these are linked up to a common Dropbox folder with all my writing stuff. I have **no** excuse not to log this stuff anymore.

Spent a lot of time redesigning my personal website today. Now has a much bigger emphasis on the projects I've done. Most of the copy is going yo stay the same though - with a few tweaks here and there. 

As an aside, I gotta say: working in regular 'ole CSS and HTML can be refreshing. Brings me back to my younger days.
