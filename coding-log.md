# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Wednesday, July 14, 2017

I'm going to try and take this coding log thing seriously. I've tried to do it twice now, but everytime I completely forget to update it. That's dumb. It's not like I'm not coding too, so my excuse is one of pure laziness. 

I've streamlined the process for myself a little bit, which I'm hoping will make things easier for me. Installed [Typora](https://typora.io/) on my computer and [Byword](https://bywordapp.com/) on my phone. Both of these are linked up to a common Dropbox folder with all my writing stuff. I have **no** excuse not to log this stuff anymore.

Spent a lot of time redesigning my personal website today. Now has a much bigger emphasis on the projects I've done. Most of the copy is going yo stay the same though - with a few tweaks here and there. 

As an aside, I gotta say: working in regular 'ole CSS and HTML can be refreshing. Brings me back to my younger days. 

### Day 2: Thursday, July 15, 2017

Spent more time refreshing my portfolio site and playing around with some of the tricker CSS properties like display and position. I've been a standard block guy for a while now but I'm starting to understand relative, inline-block, etc. and how they all function together.

Completed [Detect Capital](https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-capital/) on Leetcode. My solution works, but seeing what other people came up with makes it clear that learning regex would be helpful for these types of problems.

### Day 3: Friday, July 16, 2017

Worked on some more portfolio stuff and started building out various different React apps, but then I decided that was a bad idea so I plugged away at my college app.

### Day 4: Saturday, July 17, 2017

Got some serious refactoring done on the college app. Redesigned the UI as well - so it doesn't suck as much anymore. It's still definitely not there but getting closer.

### Day 5: Sunday, July 18, 2017

Worked on my personal site a little bit. Added some of the newer projects that I've been working on. 

### Day 6: Monday, July 19, 2017

Worked a bit on the Feedback dashboard.

### Day 7: Tuesday, July 20, 2017

Did more work on Feedback today. Shaping up quite nicely!

Also watched one of Wes Bos JS30 videos before bed. Really need to reintroduce that series into my life - its a good way to keep those JS skills sharp.
